# Browser Automation project using a custom language

Authors : Victor Barreteau -- Younes Ghoniem

# Goal of this project 
The Goal of this project was to design a DSL capable of making browser operations in the same way Selenium would.

This project is to be able to complete 8 different test cases in order to be successful.

# Accomplishments

In this repository you'll find the eclipse project containing the xtext file implementing our grammar called BAD.

Aswell as the generated and completed xtend files.

We were able in this during this project to accomplish all test cases that you'll find in this repo aswell under the `bad-cases` directory.

Those files are .bad files which are implementations of our DSL for the test cases.
